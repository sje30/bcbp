## R code

### sjedrp package

You will need to install the `sjedrp` package from my home page:

    Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("sjedrp"), type="source", contriburl="http://damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/eglen/r/")'

Then to test this is working:

    cd code/data
	make
	
and check the resulting file `code/data/bcbp_verify.pdf`.
